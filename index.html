  <h1>Welcome to Bitter Scientist!</h1>
  <h3>A website dedicated to analytics, data science, and general office technology.</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="general-p">
    Finding information you need online isn't easy. Most google
    queries will pull up umpteen blog posts, and website threads that go into excessive (and sometimes contradictory)
    details, making the task of wading through all the garbage frustrating. The goal of this site is to provide
    educational information on tools commonly used in data science, in a concise manner, and to post science projects that show how these elements
    come together.
