        <h1>Welcome to Bitter Scientist!</h1>
        <h3>A website dedicated to analytics, data science, and general office technology.</h3>

      <p class="general-p">
        Finding information you need online isn't easy. Most google
        queries will pull up umpteen blog posts, and debate threads that go into excessive (and sometimes contradictory)
        details, making the task of wading through all the garbage frustrating. The main goal of this site is to provide
        educational information on tools commonly used in data science, in a concise, easy to access, manner. The second
        goal is to post data science projects that show how these elements
        come together, by either using publicly, or curated data sets.
