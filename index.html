    <p>Welcome to BitterScientist.com, a repository of information on topics such as Statistics, and programming.  <br><br>This website was created for folks who want to learn more about these topics, but have little technical background or academic exposure, and don't have all day to figure it out.  <br><br>The goal is to help you find the material you need, without having to waddle through all the fluff.  Math and science is hard, learning shouldn't be.</p>
