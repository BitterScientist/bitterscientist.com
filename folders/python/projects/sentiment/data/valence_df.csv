I think my negative experiences this block were solely because the first step of our project has not been successful, which has made things difficult. But, I think that's also an important learning experience when it comes to research. Not everything is going to go smoothly, not all of your data will be significant or go as planned.

"Would you please describe any challenges you faced this block?
Such as: scheduling conflicts, access to facilities, equipment issues, etc,"," My primary challenge this block was not being able to use lab equipment (PCR machines) because they were being used by other research students. There was no online scheduling form/calendar that allowed me to reserve specific time slots so that I could make sure I could use the equipment I needed when I went to lab.,I faced some challenges with scheduling pics ups with samples because everyone has had different schedules, including myself, the practices, and . But through better communication and scheduling, all of the kinks have been worked out., Ordering supplies has been an issue and dealing with limited space, but we all do our best. ,Scheduling was the largest conflict I had this block. I am heavily involved with a club on campus and had some clinical skills rotations scheduled at the same time that the anesthesia team performed some studies. However, the team is extremely flexible and we worked around our scheduling conflicts by planning study dates as early as possible to avoid scheduling conflicts. ,when the fish would not breed, I could not do my project, We faced issues with culturing the anaerobic organisms.  Dawes has completed a similar experiment successfully in the past, but used the anaerobic chamber. We are using anaerobic jars (sealed containers with packaging that will eliminate the aerobic conditions) and we did not have success any of the times we attempted to culture the bacteria.
Because we have not successfully cultured or isolated the C. perfringens, we are unable to continue with the next step of the experiment. 

The scheduling is a little difficult now that  Dawes is doing the clinical skills labs for 2nd years on Tuesdays or Thursdays. Typically that would be when I could work (if I didn't have clinical skills myself). We have been able to work around it for the most part, but it has made things more difficult. I believe that if we are able to get to the next steps of the experiment, or when we get the chickens, this will be much less of an issue because I will be able to go in by myself. ,Access to facilities (off campus field work),I had been injured and unable to use my hand for a few weeks, so that was a challenge. Also some things with our tissues didn't go as planned but nothing that can't be fixed. ,As I mentioned previously, the scheduling between classes and  Dawes' schedule and clinical skills schedule is challenging, but we are making it work and finally have begun moving forward with everything now that we are able to use the anaerobic chamber. However  I have been told that we are getting chickens, and so far, we have yet to get them. There seems to be an issue with the IACUC approval, and so there's nothing I can really do to help it. Luckily there's still other lab work that I have available and have been working on completing. I got into this project really wanting to work with the chickens, but I guess research never goes as planned, so it's a good thing to experience. ,None, The biggest challenged I faced was finding hours that worked with my school schedule and with . ,Scheduling seemed to be the main culprit which limited learning opportunities.

But my mentor worked really hard to accommodate our schedules., Scheduling was a little difficult for my team and I, mostly because we had a lot to accomplish within 5 weeks and it got a little tiring by the end of week 5.

Such as: scheduling conflicts, access to facilities, equipment issues, lack of reagents, etc","The only thing that was hard was the inventory SOP because I had only been in the lab a week when we switched to virtual so I really didn't know what we needed to keep in the nitrogen tanks, but luckily  was fantastic and helped me with that. The only other thing which was out of our control was all the screen time between the program and school got to me, but again this was out of anyone's control. The joVE videos were really advanced and I honestly didn't really understand most of them. ,Access to facilities  COVID19,The new schedule for my virtual classes/rotations made it tough to coordinate and balance small animal work with research, but that is only because everything is online due to the pandemic.   was also busy with his own things which also made it a challenge sometimes, but none of these issues can be put onto someone. We all did our best with what we could., We still have have to analyze for statistical significance. ,Just my injury inhibiting my ability to type., There was a lot more time spent this block compared to other blocks so it was a challenge being productive and managing my time along with my classes, I had to write an SOP for something I had never done before in the lab and didn't know the WesternU protocol. This made this extremely difficult on where to start or how much to include. ,' Lack of access to facilities hindered my work because I was unable to grab my laboratory notebook prior to the pandemic closing the campus
 Scheduling to meet with my mentor was more difficult because of the pandemic, Yes, due to the virus we were unable to do any experiments after the original DNA extraction.
