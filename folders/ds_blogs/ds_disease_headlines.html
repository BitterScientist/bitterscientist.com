                The programming language Python was used in this project. The matplotlib and folium libraries were used

                visualize and map the data. GeoNamesCache was used to obtain geographic data. Pandas and re libraries
                were was used to wrangle the data, and the numpy, math, collections, random, and Scikit-Learn libraries
                were used in the calculations and machine learning models. Kmeans and DBSCAN were specifically used in
                the clustering methods.

                  <strong><em>Extract City and Country Information from News Headlines</em></strong><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The text data was stored in a txt file, with each headline separated by a line
                  break. The first step in this analysis is to extract the city and country information in each
                  headline, and then use that information to get the geo coordinates for those locations for downstream
                  applications. To this end,
                  <ul>
                    <li>Function to transliterate Unicode text to ASCII</li>
                    <li>Functions to map city and country name to regex objects</li>
                    <li>Function that compares a string with a dictionary, and either returns the matched string, or
                      none</li>
                    <li>These functions were applied to each headline in the dataset, two additional lists were prepared
                      1) matched cities, and 2) matched countries</li>
                    <li>The headlines, matched cities, and matched countries were then combined into a pandas dataframe
                      using a dictionary.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="general-p">
                  Close inspection of the data reveals that there are inaccurate city names listed, in particular "Of"
                  was listed 45 times in the dataset (7%) of instances. For this reason, additional measures were taken
                  to correct or remove erroneous city listings. This was accomplished by:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Create a function that returns a set containing all the cities listed in a headline.</li>
                    <li>Apply function to city column and create a new column that contains all the cities found in a
                      given headline</li>
                    <li>Create a new column that contains the count of the number of cities counted in a headline</li>
                    <li>Determine the number of headlines with more than one city</li>
                    <li>Update the city column by including the city with the longest string length.</li>
                    <li>Instances with no city or country were removed from the analysis, and this consisted of ~6%</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="general-p">
                  Once the final dataset contains accurate city and/or country information, the python library
                  <code>get_cities_by_name(city)</code> was used to provide geocoodinates for each in the dataframe. At
                  this point, the dataset was ready for analysis.

                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; To cluster headlines geographically, and then by disease, a method to
                  organize the headlines would need to be employed. One method is KMeans algorithm, which using the
                  centrality of a dataset to create clusters. For this to work, the number of clusters need to be
                  defined. One heuristic approach is the elbow method, which plots the number of clusters to the inertia
                  (variability) in the data. The more number of clusters, the smaller the inertia. The 'optimal' number
                  of cluster is the point at which the link forms a link that resembles an elbow. In this example, 3
                  seems to be the optimal cluster number, which when mapped using <code>folium</code> organizes clusters
                  into three regions.

                  <strong><em>Use DBSCAN: A Clustering Algorithm for Grouping Data Based on Spatial Density on Headline
                      Data</em></strong><br>K-Means is one method for clustering, another approach is based on density
                  to discover clusters. While K-means relies on central points to group clusters, density methods are
                  not, and can create more nuanced clusters, just as rings or irregular shapes. This method has two key
                  parameters, <code>epsilon</code> and <code>min_points</code>. Epsilon refers to the distance between
                  points, and min_points are the minimal number of points to consider. When using this approach, and
                  mapping the clusters, we see a more nuanced distribution of groups. Specifically:
                  <ul>
                    <li>DBSCAN has generates discrete clusters in parts of South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe.</li>

                      states sharing a large proportion of headlines.</li>

                  that the US is further segmented into smaller clusters. Ultimately, we would want to evaluate the
                  pandemics in the US specifically. To this end, the US data was filtered from the larger dataset, and
                  we find that there are 31 clusters outside of the US, and that the largest of these clusters contains
                  51 disease related headlines.

                  <ul>
                    <li>The headlines nearest to the center of the largest cluster focus on mad cow disease, which was

                  The next step is to evaluate the pandemics in the US and their clustering accross the country. The
                  DBSCAN organizes the data into ~ 15 clusters, and 6 regions, as expected. When we evaluate five
                  headlines for the most central locations in each cluster, we see that Zika seems to be present in many
                  of these clusters. This would suggest pandemics in these areas. The next step is to determine if the
                  headlines are present in tropical areas, or areas near large bodies of water, which are common
                  location for vector borne diseases such as Zika.
