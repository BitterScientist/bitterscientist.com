                  <B>Statcast: </B> is an advance tool that combines doppler radar, and high definition video processing
                  to measure the speed, acceleration, and other moving properties of objects in motion. Statcast is a
                  result of the combined technology of TrackMan, and ChyronHego. Stacast is used in various sports,
                  including Major League Baseball to track in-game biomechanics. In MLB, this is primarily for pitchers
                  and hitters, although it captures all game related activities. The data collected has been used to
                  evaluate player performances, and to help diagnose performance problems that may prevent injuries.
                </p>
                <p class="general-p"><strong>Why is this important?</strong><br>
                  Information gathering technology can provide a competitive edge in sports (and other industries).
                  Statcast in particular, can generate roughly <em>seven terabytes of data</em>, and this information
                  can provide insights that include aid in scouting top talent, and player development. These insights
                  can be powerful, but insights are unlocked from data by good analytics, and having a keen
                  understanding of the data, and the tools available to analyze it, are essential at driving value from
                  gathered data.

                This research was limited by the availability of data, or it was until
                the advent of technologies like Statcast. Statcast combines advance doppler radar, and high definition
                video processing to generate a wide portfolio of baseball player biometrics, and batting event outcomes.
                This era of big data has made home run mechanics easier to decipher. When considering batting behaviors
                in particular, the batting launch angle, and launch speed have become key indicators of home run events.

                In fact, these findings have had an impact on the average MLB launch angle and launch speed, with

                <br>
                The top home run batters for the 2019 World Series teams was identified by analyzing the team statistics
                for each team. The team statistics was obtained from the website <a
                  href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/">Baseball-reference</a>. Since the data was unavailable in a
                downloadable format, the python libraries requests, lxml.html, and pandas were used to harvest this data
                from each team webpage. The code used to gather this data can be downloaded in this jupyter notebook <a
                  href="projects/2019_mlb_final_hitters/Extraction_webscraping_html_table.ipynb"

                  (HOU)</a>. To identify the top home run batters, the data was analyzed using the python libraries
                pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The code used to analyze this data can be downloaded in this
                jupyter notebook <a href="projects/2019_mlb_final_hitters/EDA_2019WS_Top_HR_Batters.ipynb"

                <strong><em>Gathering Statcast Data for the top Home Run Batters in the Astros and
                    Nationals</em></strong><br>
                The 2019 Statcast data for each player was retrieved from <a
                  href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search">Baseballsavant.mlb.com</a>. Although this
                website enables users to query their database, it does not provide the option to download the results of
                an
                advance search.
                To this end, a python script developed by <a
                  href="https://github.com/alanrkessler/savantscrapersavantscraper."> Alan R Kessler.</a> was used to
                capture data from advance StatCast searches, and save it into an sqlite database. The python libraries
                sqlite3 and pandas was then used to query and save the data into csv files. Since Statcast uses integer
                IDs to store player identities, the names corresponding to each player ID was determined by inspecting
                the player Statcast page, and searching through the <code>section id="player"</code> tag. This ID number
                was then used to filter for these players in the Statcast 2019 season database. The code used to analyze
                this data can be downloaded in this jupyter notebook <a

                <strong><em>Analysis</em><br></strong>
                Python was used in this project. Data was loaded and manipulated using the pandas library. The
                matplotlib and seaborn libraries were used to visualize data. The scipy, scikit_posthocs, sklearn, and <a href="http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/cite/">mlxend</a>
                libraries were used in the statistical analysis. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality,
                while the Barlette's test was used to test for equal variance. For parametric data, ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test
                were used to test for differences between players, while for non-parametric data, the Kruskal-Wallis H-test for independent samples and dunn post-hoc test were used.  The Support vector machine model was used to
                determine if launch speed and launch angle are predictors of home run events. Detailed methods can be found in the jupyter notebook.

                    There were thirty-three possible batting outcomes. These outcomes range from field outs (the most
                    common events), to picked off caught stealing 3rd base. The top 10 batting outcomes for Bregman, Rendon, and Soto are displayed in Figure 5. The top six events, by count, were field outs,

                    singles, doubles, and then home runs.<br> Although this order is used to cluster player batting
                    events in Figure 5, the rankings by magnitude varies by player. Bregman's batting events ranks were
                    as followed: 1) Field outs, 2) walks, 3) strikeouts, 4) singles, 5) home runs, 6) doubles.<br>

                    had 50 more strikeouts than both players, but managed to out score Rendon in HR percentage of

                    Statcast also tracks hit distance, this is the position (in ft) that the ball travels after being struck at the plate.   The farthest hit in the 2019 season was 505 ft (Figure 6).  For the the three players in this analysis, Soto had the farthest hit distance at
                    449
                    ft (N = 429, M 193.4 Â± 145.1 SD), followed by Bregman at 440 ft (N = 476, M 200.1 Â± 135.9 SD), and Rendon at 432 ft (N = 473, M 210.5 Â± 136.8 SD ) (Table 1, Figure 7). Interestingly, the trends in the descriptive statistics for home run hit distance did not follow the same patterns observed with all hitting events (Table 2). Soto had the highest mean hit distance, followed by Rendon, and ending with Bregman (Figure 8).  Since the distance traveled by home runs for each player was normally distributed (Figure 9) and had equal variance. An analysis of variance was conduced to test the hypothesis that the mean hit distance for home run events did not vary
                    among players. The results
                    confirmed that the mean hit distance does vary significantly between players (p = 3.845e-05), and a
                    Tukey's Post Hoc test suggest that the hit distance between Bregman and Rendon (p = 0.015183), and
                    Bregman and Soto (p = 0.001000) were significantly different.  Taken together, we can conclude that both Rendon and Soto hit the ball farther than Bregman, but there was not difference in the hit distance between Rendon and Soto.

                    Prior studies using Statcast data indicate the batter launch speed and launch angle are key home run
                    parameters.  Launch speed is the velocity of the ball after it is hit by the batter, and the launch angle is the vertical angle at which the ball leaves a player's bat after being struck.

                    To confirm these observations, a scatter plot for all batted events in the 2019 season were plotted against their launch
                    speed and launch angle (Figure 10).
                    Indeed, the majority of home run events for all players clustered between 20Â° - 40Â° launch angles,
                    and above 90 mph launch speed.  This pattern was also consistent with the players in this study (Figure 11-13). <br><br>

                    <strong><em>Soto's Home Runs have the highest launch speed, while Bregman had the slowest. </em></strong><br>
                    To evaluate the launch angle and launch speeds of home runs by player, individual scatter plots were
                    prepared (Figure 14). The plots suggest that Soto hit the ball with more force, while Bregman had a
                    slower launch speeds than both Rendon and Soto. When comparing the actual summary statistics for these
                    values (Table 3), Soto did indeed have the highest launch
                    speed (M 105.61 mph Â± 4.39 SD), followed by Rendon (M 101.36 Â± 2.76 SD), and ending with Bregman (M
                    99.87 Â± 3.46 SD). A Kruskal-Wallis H-test for independent samples was conducted to test the
                    hypothesis that there was no statistically significant difference in launch speed between players.
                    This hypothesis was rejected (statistic=37.90, pvalue=5.91e-09), and a Dunn Post Hoc analysis
                    confirmed that Soto's launch speed is significantly higher than both Bregman (p = 4.14e-09) and
                    Rendon (p = 0.000133).
                    When comparing launch angles, Rendon had the largest mean angle (M 30.97 Â± 5.00 SD), followed by
                    Bregman (M 39.59 Â± 5.64 SD) and ending with Soto (M 29.51 Â± 5.32 SD).  The launch angles for home runs was normally distributes (Shapiro-Wilk), and had equal variance (Barlette's test).  An analysis of variance confirmed that there was no difference in the mean launch angles (p = 0.6223).

                <strong><em>Predicting events with Machine Learning.</em></strong><br>
                Machine learning has become a ubiquitous tool in data science.  It enables users to combine advance statistics, and computer science, without having to conduct all the complicated calculations.  So far, Figure 6-9 in this blog suggest that launch speed and launch would be good parameters for identifying home run events.  Although visually convincing, advance statistical techniques would need to be used to determine their use in predicting if a batting events will result in a home run. <br><br>
                <strong><em>Finding the right model: Logistic Regression versus Support Vector Machine </em></strong><br>
                There are several models that can be used to build a predictive algorithm.  Since the target for this dataset are home run events, which are dichotomous by nature ("yes" or "no"; 0 or 1), a logistic regression model seemed ideal.  Although, given the circular clustering of the home run data in Figure 6-9, would suggest that any linear models would underperform in their classification reports. In fact, a logistic regression model yielded an accuracy score >90% for both the training and test set, but performed terribly in the confusion matrix analysis.  The logistic regression model did well at predicting true negatives (which contributed to the high accuracy score), but it did terribly at classifying true positives, and false negatives. In fact, the f1-score for home runs was ~0.30 (data not shown).  If you're wondering why, there are two primary reasons: 1) most events are not home runs, so by the numbers, the logistic regression model will correctly classify these events, 2) the home run events are cluster in a circle, and surrounded by non home run events.  This makes it difficult for a decision boundary to be established using a logistic regression model. For these reasons, SVM is a more appropriate tool, as it allows for complex modeling of data using non linear decision boundaries.<br><br>
                <strong><em>Support Vector Machine Modeling Predicts Home Runs 70% of the time</em></strong><br>
                The non linear SVG was conducted using the gamma and C parameters set to 1.  The accuracy score for both the training and test set was 97%.  Plotting a subset of this data showed that the model built a decision boundary around the area home runs are scored (Figure 15).  Fine tuning of the SVM parameters would be required to in order to optimize this boundary.  Tests to validate the performance of this model showed that the model classified true negatives 99% of the time, false positives 1% of the time, false negatives 32% of the time, and true positives at 68% of the time (Figure 16).  Moreover, the classification report (Table 4) reveals that the model had a precision score for home runs at 78%, a recall score at 67%, and an f1-score at 72%.<br>

In the 2019 season, the mean pitch speed for all pitches was 88.9 mph Â± 5.8 SD (N = 187529). The mean pitch speed Bregman (N = 749, M 89.3 Â± 5.7 SD), Rendon (N= 711, M 89.9 Â± 5.5 SD), and Soto (N = 730, M 88.9 Â± 5.8 SD) encountered at the plate is consisted with the season average. The the mean pitch speed for all events that resulted in a home runs for each player was slightly different (Table 5).  Both Bregman and Rendon had a  reduction in their mean pitch speed, while Soto hit faster pitched balls (Figure 17).  To determine if there were differences in the pitch velocities the players encountered at plate during the entire season, a Kruskal Wallis H-Test for Independent samples was conducted. This test was used because the pitch speed data for each player was not normally distributed (confirmed by distplot and Shapiro-Wilk test, analysis in jupyter notebook). The Kruskal Wallis H-Test rejected the null hypothesis (statistic=11.3713, pvalue=0.0033), and a Dunn's post hoc test indicates that the mean pitch speed between Soto and Rendon was significantly different (p = 0.002238), suggesting that overall, Rendon encountered faster pitched balls than Soto. To then test if the pitch speed for events that results in a home run were different, a Kruskal Wallis H-Test was also conducted on only the home run events.  This test indicates that the mean pitch speed for home run events did not differ between players (statistic=1.2435, pvalue=0.5369).  Taken together, these results suggest that Although there may have been difference in the pitch speed for all events, there was no statistical difference in the mean pitch speeds they scored home runs.

                    Statcast also tracks the location that the ball crosses the plate.  This data helps describe pitching behavior, and when hit by a batter at plate, it provides the player's hitting zone (Figure 18).  To find the batters home run zone, each pitch location associated with a home run event was assigned to a point in a 2D histogram (Figure 19).<br><br>

                    <strong><em>Alex Bregman's Home Run Zones are 4, 5, and 2.</em></strong><br>
                    Alex Bregman bats at right, and we can see in figure 15 that much of his home runs were hit in the pitch location 4, followed by 2 and 5 (Figure 20).<br><br>
                    <strong><em>Anthony Rendon's Home Run Zones are 5, 4 and 6.</em></strong><br>
                    Anthony Rendon bats at right, and we can see in figure 16 that much of his home runs were hit in the pitch location 5, 4, and 6 followed by 2 and 5 (Figure 21).<br><br>

                    <strong><em>Juan Soto's Home Run Zones are 5, 4, 2 and 3.</em></strong><br>
                    Juan Soto bats at left, and we can see in figure 17 that unlike Bregman and Rendon, he hit zone seems more distributed. Another way to describe the hit zones, is to think of the amount of white squares, which are areas with few to no events.  Soto has less squares with white than the other players, although a statistical analysis would need to be conducted to confirm this observation (Figure 22).<br><br>

                  <h4>Bringing it all together</h4>
                  The advent of technology such as Statcast, has made it possible to probe for novel in-game insights.  As highlighted in this blog, Statcast can be used to evaluate the various batting event outcomes, determine which players hit the farthest, determine which batter related events are predictors of home runs, and even explore pitcher related events.  The analysis conducted in this study are only the tip of the iceberg, so much more can be asked, such as what batting events are more likely to result in a field out, what areas of the field are balls hits typically hit, which players have the highest number of steals, and what other factors may contribute to home run events. The questions seems unlimited, although Statcast does not track every baseball event.  For example, in this post, we show that Alex Bregman, the top home run player in this analysis, may not have been the most powerful hitter (his hit distance was significantly slower than Soto), nor were his hit angles statistically different from Bregman and Soto. So what then accounts for the difference in home run scores?  It might not be height, as both Bregman and Rendon are 6' tall (Soto is 6'2).  One factor that has been suggested is not the players, but the material of the baseball.  In fact, reporting done by several independent groups suggest that the exterior, and interior parts of the ball have changed over the years, and these changes have enabled balls to fly farther.

                  Despite these findings, Statcast still provides valuable insights into one of America's favorite pastime, and I for one, will go to baseball games with a renewed outlook. </p>
