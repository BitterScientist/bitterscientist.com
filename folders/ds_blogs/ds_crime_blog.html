                <B>LA Crime Data: </B> <br>
                Los angeles county is an area with over 10 million inhabitants (1), and is the third largest city by
                GDP in the world (2). As the population continues to grow, efforts to track, and understand criminal
                activities are critical at ensuring the city remain safe for its inhabitants, attractive to business and
                tourism. In the wake of mass shootings, crimes
                involving weapons has become an important
                political issues. Fire arm's in particular, have been at the center of this discourse, and although this
                may be true for mass shootings, an analysis on whether other weapons should be targeted by policy
                makers is needed.
                The aim of this study is to analyze over 2
                million crime incidents reported in LA between 2010 - 2019 (3), and characterize the victims reported in
                these crimes, the weapons that are
                commonly reported, and the crimes that are involved.
              </p>
              <p class="general-p"><strong>Why is this important?</strong><br>
                Understanding these trends can help inform policies that aim at reducing their incidents.

                between 2010 - 2019. The dataset is refreshed weekly, and is transcribed from crime reports typed on
                paper. The dataset contains over 2 million records, and 28
                features. Only thirteen features were used in this study: date reported, victim age, victim sex, victim
                descent, major crime code committed, crime description, major weapon used code, weapon description,
                status code, and status of case, LAPD area crime was committed, and the crime lat and long.

                crime code, but only the major (or first), crime code listed was used in this study.

                to clarify the definitions for 'H', 'N', and '_' categories. Only 'M' and 'F' categories were
                included in this study, although it would be interesting to determine how transgender identified
                individuals are victimized by crimes in LA. A separate study would need to be conducted, for this post,
                only "M" and "F" categories will be included.

                <strong><em>Interactive map using leaflet </em></strong><br>
                To allow users to explore the geographical distribution of weapon related crimes in LA, the javascript
                Leaflet library
                was used as described (4, 5). Only data from the 2019 calendar year was used in this interactive plot.
                Data was restricted to crimes involving weapons. Up to forty geographical markers are displayed at a
                given time, and not all weapon categories will have markers, as they may not have been reported at the
                time of this study.

                <strong><em>Analysis</em><br></strong>
                The programming language Python was used in this project. Data was loaded and manipulated using the
                pandas library. The
                matplotlib and seaborn libraries were used to visualize data. The scipy and statsmodels.api libraries
                were used in the statistical analysis. Normality was evaluated using a qqplot, while the Barlette's
                test was used to test for equal variance. A Welch's t-test for two independent samples was used to
                determine statistical differences between groups that did not have equal variance.

                weapon reported. Although, the use of fire arms was listed 4 times (Hand gun (rank 3), Semi-automatic
                pistol (rank5), unknown firearm (7), revolver (10)), to total sum of
                these incidents (60,448) is a 14th of those reported with strong-arm (429,671). It is possible this
                lower levels of gun violence may be attributed to gun control measures (access or cost).

                <strong><em>Assault is the most common crime involving weapons (Figure 3).</em></strong><br>
                In the dataset, there were over 140 unique crime descriptions listed. The top 10 weapon related crimes
                had more
                than 9000 incidents reported each, and some of these crimes fall in categories that are redundant. For
                example, domestic violence appears twice (#2 and # 6), robbery\burglary four times (#4, #7, #8, #10),
                and assault\battery\threats four times
                (#1, #3, #6, #9). The fact that these categories appear multiple times are indicative of their
                prevalence
                in society. Battery and the threat of physical harm (Assault) are the most represented in this dataset,
                and would be a potential target for policies geared towards addressing anger and violence, and the
                systemic causes of these events.<br>

                Strong-arm was the overwhelming majority in assault, battery, and robbery cases (Figure 5). Firearms
                were the next category with a good proportion within the to 10
                crimes involving weapons. Verbal
                threats was the predominant category in crimes involving criminal threats, and the use of vehicles was
                recoded in cases involving assault with a deadly weapon. Unknown weapons was reported in crimes
                involving assault with a deadly weapon and robbery.

                When comparing the incidents of specific weapons in reported crimes, all but strong-arm seem to be
                stable (Figure 5). The total number of crimes involving strong-arm increase from 2013 - 2018, and this
                may account for the total increase in weapon related crimes, despite the reduction in total overall

                To determine if there was indeed a statistically different mean age of victims by sex, a Welch’s
                t-test for independent samples was conducted. A qqplot was used to evaluate normality in the dataset
                (Figure 11), and a Barlette's test was conducted to evaluate the variance in the two groups. These
                tests confirm the need to use the Welch's test, which indicated to reject the null hypothesis that
                there were no difference in the mean age of victims in weapon related crimes by sex (p = 3.76e-125).
                There is a significant difference in the age of female and male victims in weapon related crimes, which
                suggest younger women are at greater risk of victimization.

                In this part of the study, we decided to investigate the entire dataset, including those reported in
                2019.
                There are 21 areas listed in this dataset, and these areas correspond to LAPD station areas (Figure 14).
                The areas with the highest
                number of total crimes, and weapon related crimes was 77th street, Southeast, and Southwest (Figure
                15, Figure 16). Although the data for these areas trend together, the data also indicate that an area
                can rank higher in weapon related crimes, but rank lower in total overall crimes. An example of this
                would be Hollenbeck, which ranks 10ths in weapon related crimes, but ranks last in total overall crimes.
                Taken
                together, this data suggest that weapon related incidents do not associate with total overall crimes in
                all areas.

                <strong><em>Strong arm is the most frequently reported weapon related crime in all
                    areas.</em></strong><br>
                To determine the distribution of the top 10 weapons reorted by area, a proportional bar plot
                was prepared. The proportion of weapons reported by area seem consistent, with strong arm representing
                the largest proportion, followed by verbal threats and fire arms (Figure 17).<br>
                When we examine all crimes in Figure 18, we do see that areas have a unique reporting fingerprint. For
                example, WestLA, which has a median household
                income of $78,713 (7) had similar number of assault on firefighter or peace officer with deadly weapons,
                than those reported in the 77th street area, which as a median household income of $35,660 (7). This is
                interesting because one would assume crimes against civil servants would be higher in areas with lower
                income. A study would need to be conducted to determine if median household income trends with specific
                crimes by area.

                <strong><em>Concluding remarks.</em></strong><br>
                The aim of this study was to analyze over 2 million crime incidents reported in LA between 2010 - 2019
                (3), and characterize the victims reported in these crimes, the weapons that are commonly reported, and
                the crimes that are involved.
                From this cursory analysis we see that:
                <ul>
                  <li>More than 200,000 crimes are reported annually in LA by LAPD.</li>
                  <li>Strong arm, and firearms are most frequently the weapons reported in crimes.</li>
                  <li>Assault and theft are the most frequently reported crimes.</li>
                  <li>Weapon related crimes are nearly a quarter of reported crimes.</li>
                  <li>Victims of all crimes are in generally in their 30s.</li>
                  <li>Victims of weapon related crimes are generally younger.</li>
                  <li>Female victims of weapon related crimes are younger than male victims.</li>
                  <li>Hispanic, whites, and blacks are the largest group of victims, with hispanic being the largest
                    group of victims.</li>
                  <li>The 77th LAPD area has the highest number of crimes, and highest number of weapon related crimes.
                  </li>
                  <li>Each LAPD area has a unique reported crime signature, that may be influenced by the socioeconomic
                    demographic of the community it serves.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Taken together, although firearms should continue to be an issue policy makers address, assault and
                battery, especially domestic violence, by the numbers, is a bigger problem that should also be
                addressed. Especially measures to protect women. This analysis was a tip of the iceberg, so much can be
                explored, in particular, the impact that any interventions may have placed at suppressing, or reducing
                the numbers of crimes reported in 2019.
