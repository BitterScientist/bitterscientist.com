                  Los angeles county is an area with over 10 million inhabitants (1), and is the third largest city by
                  GDP in the world (2). As the population continues to grow, efforts to track, and understand criminal
                  activity are important at curtailing this phenomenon, and make the city more attractive to businesses,
                  tourism, and investments. In the wake of mass shootings, weapon related crimes has become an important
                  political issue. Gun's have been at the center of this discourse, although an analysis of the top 10
                  weapons reported in crimes has been poorly documented. The aim of this study is to analyze over 2
                  million crime incidents reported in LA between 2010 - 2019 (3), and:

                  between 2010 - 2019. The dataset is refreshed weekly, and is transcribed from crime reports typed on
                  paper. The dataset was access the first week of Dec 2019, so the entire dataset for 2019 was
                  incomplete at the time of this analysis. The dataset originally contained 2.1 million records, and 28
                  features. Only thirteen features were used in this study: 'Date Rptd', 'Vict Age', 'Vict Sex', 'Vict
                  Descent', 'Crm Cd 1', 'Weapon Used Cd', 'Weapon Desc', 'Status', 'Status Desc', 'AREA NAME' , 'LAT',
                  'LON'. The analysis excluded records that had missing values for these features: 'Weapon_Desc',
                  'Vict_Sex', 'Vict_Desc', 'Crime_Code', 'Status'.

                  Since the 2019 data was incomplete at the time of this analysis, all data for 2019 was excluded for
                  the first seven objectives described above. The interactive map in this post (objective 8) only
                  displays data from 2019, as this provides a representative sampling of incidents in LA. All years were
                  included in the last two objectives (9 and 10).

                  <strong><em>Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria for Victim </em></strong><br>
                  The dataset contained 5 categories for sex ('M', 'F', 'H', 'N', 'X'), no documentation was available
                  to clarify the H and N categories (x is unknown). Consequently, only 'M', and 'F' categories were
                  included in this study, and the rest were excluded.

                  <strong><em>Interactive map using leaflet </em></strong><br>
                  To enable users to explore the distribution of weapon related crimes, the javascript Leaflet library was used as described (4, 5).  Only data from 2019 that was used in this interactive plot.  Exclusion and inclusion criteria from above were applied here as well. Up to forty incidents are displayed at a given time, not all weapon categories will have markers, as they may not have been reported at the time of this study.

                  <strong><em>Analysis</em><br></strong>
                  Python was used in this project. Data was loaded and manipulated using the pandas library. The
                  matplotlib and seaborn libraries were used to visualize data. The scipy and statsmodels.api libraries
                  were used in the statistical analysis. A qqplot was used to evaluate normality, while the Barlette's
                  test was used to test for equal variance. A students t-test for two independent samples was used to
                  determine statistical differences between victim sex.

                  To understand the overall crime rates in LA, the total counts of crimes per year were plotted, and for
                  comparison, the total annual crimes that involve weapons were included. To total counts appear to drop
                  between 2010 to
                  2013, and then increase an on annual basis. To total crimes decrease by 1000 between 2017 to 2018,
                  whereas the number of weapon reported crimes increased by nearly 4000 (Figure 1).<br>

                  than 9000 incidents reported, and some of the categories appear redundant at first glance. For
                  example, domestic violence appears twice (#2 and # 6), robbery twice (#4 and # 9), and assault twice
                  (#3 and #10). The fact that these categories appear multiple times are indicative of their prevalence

                  and would be a potential target for policy makers at addressing anger and violence.

                  There were Seventy-Nine unique weapons reported in crimes during 2010-2018. Twenty-nine of these were
                  reported more than 1000 times, and the use of ones body to attack or threaten to attack, was the top
                  weapon reported. Although, the use of fire arms was listed 4 times (4, 5, 8, 10), to total sum of
                  these incidents (54,321) is a 7th of those reported with strong-arm (382,711). It is possible this
                  lower levels of gun violence may be attributed to gun control measures, or lack of access to guns.
                  Moreover, the dataset did not contain information about the perpetrators, and if this were available,
                  it would be helpful to know if the criminal knew the victim, and was a non-spouse/partner family
                  member, as this would be helpful in measure to counter violence.

                  As indicated in Figure 2, strong arm seems to increase towards the end of this reporting period. What
                  was not apparent were the increase in reports involving threats, knifes, hand guns, and vehicles.

                  <strong><em>Victims in this dataset are middle aged.</em></strong><br>
                  The mean age of weapon related crimes was 33.0 years old ± 16.7 (33.8 for mean, and 32.9 for women
                  Table 4, 5), while the mean age for all victims
                  was 31.8 years old ± 20.6. It is important to note that when the age of the victim was unknown, zero
                  was reported as their age, and this was the case for 29688 weapon related incidents in this dataset.
                  Interestingly, it appears that there are more younger female victims of weapon related crimes (figure
                  4), since the left hand skewing in the female victim histogram is greater than that for men, which may
                  suggest younger women are at greater risk to weapon related violence.

                  To determine if there was indeed a statistically different mean age of victims by sex, a Welch’s

                  (Figure 5), and a Barlette's test was conducted to evaluate the variance in the two groups. These
                  tests confirm the need to use the Welch's test, which indicated to reject the null hypothesis that
                  there were no difference in the mean age of victims in weapon related crimes by sex (p = 2.912e-89).
                  There is a significant difference in the age of female and male victims in weapon related crimes.

                  <strong><em>Strong-arm is represented in most of the crime categories.</em></strong><br>
                  Strong-arm was the overwhelming majority in spousal abuse, battery, robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon (Table 7, Figure 7). Firearms were the next category with a good proportion within the to 10 crimes involving weapons (robber, assault with a deadly weapon, assault on a peace officer). Verbal threats was the predominant category in crimes involving criminal threats, and the use of vehicles was overwhelming recoded in cases involving assault with a deadly weapon.  Unknown weapons had the highest proportion of cases in crimes involving assault on a firefighter or peace officer with a deadly weapon.  It begs the question, how can you have an unknown weapon, but record the incident as an assault with a deadly weapon criminal code.

                      There are 21 areas listed in this dataset (LAPD station map Figure 9). The areas with the highest number of total crimes, and weapon related crimes was 77th street, Southeast, and Southwest (Figure 10, Figure 11). Although the data for these areas trend together, the data also indicate that an area can rank higher in weapon related crimes, but rank lower in total overall crimes.  An example of this would be Hollenbeck, which ranks 9ths in weapon related crimes, but 21 in total overall crimes. Taken together, this data suggest that weapon related incidents do not trend with total overall crimes, and that some areas are affected by a unique set of crimes.
