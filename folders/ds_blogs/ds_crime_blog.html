                  <B>LA Crime Data: </B> <br>
                  Los angeles county is an area with over 10 million inhabitants (1), and is the third largest city by
                  GDP in the world (2). As the population continues to grow, efforts to track, and understand criminal
                  activity are important at curtailing this phenomenon, and make the city more attractive to businesses,
                  tourism, and investments. In the wake of mass shootings, weapon related crimes has become an important
                  political issue. Gun's have been at the center of this discourse, although an analysis of the top 10
                  weapons reported in crimes has been poorly documented. The aim of this study is to analyze over 2
                  million crime incidents reported in LA between 2010 - 2019 (3), and:

                    <li>Determine how these weapons have been reported over time.</li>
                    <li>Determine the age distribution of victims.</li>

                    <li>Provide an interactive map that allows users to explore weapon related crimes reported in 2019.

                  <strong><em>Crime data filtered for incidents with weapons</em></strong>
                  <br>
                  The data was accessed from Data.la.city.org (3) <a
                    href="https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-Present/63jg-8b9z">Crime Data from
                    2010 to Present</a> This dataset contains incidents of crimes reported in the City of Los Angeles
                  between 2010 - 2019. The dataset is refreshed weekly, and is transcribed from crime reports typed on
                  paper. The dataset was access the first week of Dec 2019, so the entire dataset for 2019 was
                  incomplete at the time of this analysis. The dataset originally contained 2.1 million records, and 28
                  features. Only thirteen features were used in this study: 'Date Rptd', 'Vict Age', 'Vict Sex', 'Vict
                  Descent', 'Crm Cd 1', 'Weapon Used Cd', 'Weapon Desc', 'Status', 'Status Desc', 'AREA NAME' , 'LAT',
                  'LON'. The analysis excluded records that had missing values for these features: 'Weapon_Desc',
                  'Vict_Sex', 'Vict_Desc', 'Crime_Code', 'Status'.

                  <strong><em>Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria for 2019 Data</em></strong><br>
                  Since the 2019 data was incomplete at the time of this analysis, all data for 2019 was excluded for
                  the first seven objectives described above. The interactive map in this post (objective 8) only
                  displays data from 2019, as this provides a representative sampling of incidents in LA. All years were
                  included in the last two objectives (9 and 10).

                  <hr>
                  <strong><em>Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria for Victim </em></strong><br>
                  The dataset contained 5 categories for sex ('M', 'F', 'H', 'N', 'X'), no documentation was available
                  to clarify the H and N categories (x is unknown). Consequently, only 'M', and 'F' categories were
                  included in this study, and the rest were excluded.

                  <strong><em>Analysis</em><br></strong>
                  Python was used in this project. Data was loaded and manipulated using the pandas library. The
                  matplotlib and seaborn libraries were used to visualize data. The scipy and statsmodels.api libraries
                  were used in the statistical analysis. A qqplot was used to evaluate normality, while the Barlette's
                  test was used to test for equal variance. A students t-test for two independent samples was used to
                  determine statistical differences between victim sex.

                    In the dataset, there were 129 unique crime codes, more than half of which had fewer than 100 incidents in this reporting period (analysis not shown).  The top 10 weapon related crimes had more than 9000 incidents reported, and some of the categories appear redundant at first glance. Domestic violence appears twice (#2 and # 6), Robbery twice (#4 and # 9), Assault twice (#3 and #10).  The fact that these categories appear multiple times are indicative of their prevalence in society.  Battery and the threat of physical harm (Assault) are most represented in this dataset.
