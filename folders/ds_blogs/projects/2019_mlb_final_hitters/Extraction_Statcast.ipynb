    " - BaseballSavant is a site dedicated to providing player matchups, Statcast metrics, and advanced statistics in a simple and easy-to-view way.<br>\n",
    "<strong>What is Statcast?</strong>\n",
    " - Statcast is a state-of-the-art tracking technology, capable of measuring previously unquantifiable aspects of the game. Set up in all 30 Major League ballparks, Statcast collects data using a series of high-resolution optical cameras along with radar equipment. The technology precisely tracks the location and movements of the ball and every player on the field, resulting in an unparalleled amount of information covering everything from the pitcher to the batter to baserunners and defensive players. Visit MLB.com's glossary for more information.\"\"\n",
