                <h4>Abstract</h4>
              </p>

              <p class="general-p">
                <strong><em>Introduction</em></strong>
                On March 4th, 2020, Los Angeles declared a local health emergency in response to the coronavirus spread
                and 6 cases in LA county (3). On March 19, 2020, the Governor of California then directed
                all residents to stay at home, effectively closing bars, public gatherings, events, conventions,
                theme parks, festivals, in person higher education, indoor playgrounds, saunas, recreational team
                sports, dine-in restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, family entertainment centers, zoos, and museums
                (4). Since then, most of these businesses have been closed or severely restricted for four months, and
                the impact of these extreme measures on the economy continues to be closely monitored by economist
                and the government. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics published a July Report summarizing a sampling of
                economic information for the Los Angeles region (4). They report that in May, California had a 15.9%
                unemployment rate, while LA city specifically, had 20.8% of its residents unemployed, this is 2 in every
                10 individuals. Moreover, a study published by UCD in April of 2020, reported that the stay-at-home
                order costs California $46 million/week reduction in SB1 fuel tax funds and ~$161 million/week in total
                fuel tax revenues for California state and local transportation projects (6). These estimates are only a
                small sampling of a potentially larger issue, given the size of the California economy - which in 2019
                would rank the fifth largest economy if it were
                a sovereign nation (7). Therefore, it is important that policy makers conduct a thorough cost-analysis
                on the short
                and long term impacts that the stay-at-home policy could have on the economy, and include this data in
                their decision making.<br><br>
                <strong>The goal</strong> of this post was to examine business growth before and after the stay-at-home
                order, using data prepared by the City of Los Angeles. Growth is defined as new active businesses that
                are registered with the City of Los Angeles in a given year, and did not notify the City of a cease in
                business operation. I surmised that business growth declined after the stay-at-home order was decreed,
                and that these numbers would be lower than the number of new businesses established during the same
                period in 2018 and 2019. <strong>Important caveat</strong>, this post was published using data released
                in July-15-2020 by the Office of Finance, and the dataset did not include information on businesses that
                closed, moreover, the dataset only contains the instances until July 15 2020, therefore, it is possible
                that the total number of new businesses may increase as the year progresses, and that the final number
                of new businesses may coincide with the range of businesses reported in the previous years. To account
                for this limitation, this study also compared the number of new businesses for each year between
                2015-2020 for the months of Jan - end of June.<br><br>
                <strong>Major Findings:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Between 2015-2019, the total annual number of new businesses ranged between 25,000 - 35,000.</li>
                  <li>By July 2020, the total annual number of new businesses in LA was ~15,000s. When comparing just
                    the number of new businesses between Jan to the end of june, the total for 2020 so far, was well
                    bellow by ~ 5000 as compared to the previous 4 years.</li>
                  <li>The drop in new businesses occurred in February, and not March, as hypothesized.</li>
                  <li>Of the top 20 cities within LA that have the highest number of new businesses, all cities had a
                    drop in new businesses for the period of Jan - end of June, as compared to the 2019 values.</li>
                  <li>All of the top 10 business classifications in LA, had a drop in new business as compared to the
                    previous year. Lessors of real estate had the largest drop in new
                    active businesses (67% reduction) as compared to the 2019 values. The other hard hit
                    business classifications include full-service restaurants, independent artists, writers, and
                    performers, janitorial services, motion picture and video industries (except video rentals), and
                    other professional, scientific, and technical services (to name a few).</li>
                  <li>Some of the top 10 business classifications were already seeing a decline in annual new businesses
                    prior to COVID, while two classifications were seeing an annual increase (single family housing
                    construction, full-service restaurants, specialty trade contractors), although these numbers plunge
                    well below half the 2019 values.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
                The stay-at-home orders were imposed as a public health measure to control the spread of this novel Coronavirus, and reduce the number of deaths. To date, of the 39.51 million Californians, only 7889 individuals have been reported to have died due to Covid-19. Although every life lost is a tragedy, and we must continue to exercise caution when interacting with those most vulnerable, we must also consider ways to protect industry, especially since economists have argued that long term growing economies are associated with longer and healthier living (8).  This project sought to understand how the stay-at-home order in LA may have impacted business growth. I specifically look at the number of new active businesses by cities, by business classifications.  I also used two time period in this analysis 1) annual trends, and 2) the period between Jan to the end of June to gain greater insight into business growth trends on an annual basis, and during the period that the stay at home order was imposed.  The findings from this study suggest that the stay-at-home order had reduced the absolute number, and percent of new business for the top 20 cities in LA, and for the top 10 business classifications.  In fact, the number of new business started to drop in February, they plunge in March, when the order was put into effect. What long-term impacts this will have on city and state economy is yet to be determined, but it would be important to investigate the rate of business closures, and the debt burden these stay-at-home measures have and will continue to impose, as government officials use this to control the spread of Covid19.

                  <strong>Question 1: How have the total number of new active businesses changed Between 2015 -
                    2020?</em></strong><br><br>To determine if the onset of Covid-19 in LA have had an impact on the
                  number of new businesses in LA, a bar plot of the total number of new businesses by year was charted.
                  As figure 1 and 2 illustrates, the total number of new active businesses in LA between 2016-2019 was over
                  35,000 new business, and this number then drops to ~15,000 between Jan- July 2020. When compared to previous years within the same time frame, the number in 2020 is well below 5000 new businesses. These findings suggest that the lower numbers we see in 2020 may not be a result
                  of seasonality (intra-annual variation in business growth), but rather a consequence of COVID19 on the LA economy.<br>

                  <strong><em>Question 2: What is the total number of active business by city per
                      year?</em></strong><br><br>
                  Los Angeles consists of a patchwork of many small cities, which in this dataset consists of 1672
                  areas! Looking at whether the onset of COVID in LA has affected each city would be a monumental
                  exercise, instead, I decided to focus only on the top 20 cities that have had the highest number of
                  new active businesses. This included:<br>
                  'LOS ANGELES', 'VAN NUYS', 'NORTH HOLLYWOOD', 'SHERMAN OAKS', 'WOODLAND HILLS', 'ENCINO',
                  'NORTHRIDGE', 'STUDIO CITY', 'CANOGA PARK', 'RESEDA', 'TARZANA', 'VENICE', 'PANORAMA CITY', 'SYLMAR',
                  'SAN PEDRO', 'SUN VALLEY', 'GRANADA HILLS', 'CHATSWORTH', 'VALLEY VILLAGE', and 'PACOIMA'. Table 1
                  summarizes the total number of new businesses per city by year, between 2015-2020. The number of new
                  businesses for each city seems stable between 2016 - 2019, suggesting that the rate of new businesses
                  was stable, although this drops to nearly half for all cities in 2020.<br><br>

                  <strong><em>Question 3: How have the number of new businesses change by city between
                      2015-2020?</em></strong><br><br>
                  Table 2 summarizes the same data described in Table 1, although it provides percent change from year
                  to year. Those in red are a negative change. Here we see that many of the cities in this subset had
                  already seen a drop in new businesses as compared to 2018 levels, so it is possible that the rate of
                  growth was already slowing down before the government imposed a stay at home order due to concerns over
                  COVID19 on public health. <br> To compare the change of growth for just the months between Jan to the end of June, the same analysis was conducted for just this time period for each year, and we see the same trends, all cities had seen a reduction in business growth, with Encino having the largest drop, and San Pedro having the smallest drop in the percent change, as compared to 2019.<br>
                  Figure 2 and 3 helps to visualize these changes for both the annual new active businesses by city, and comparing the annual numbers for only the months between Jan - end of June.  North Hollywood and Chatsworth are insteresting in that  the rate of new businesses appear stable between 2016 - 2019, and then drop in 2020.

                  <strong><em>Question 4: What is are the number of new monthly businesses between Jan 2018 - July
                      2020?</em></strong><br><br>
                  Thus far, annual data has been analyzed, although this analysis is good at evaluating any trends
                  between 2015-2019, it is not appropriate for 2020, since it only takes 7 months into account. To
                  determine if the number of new businesses for the first 7 months of 2020 trend with the first seven
                  months in 2018 and 2019, a fever plot was prepared. We see in Figure 4 that there is indeed
                  seasonality in new businesses, with november - january having a spike, and then dropping and
                  stabilizing between Jan - Oct, with a slight dip between Oct - Nov. If you compare the curves for
                  these first seven months between 2018, 2019, and 2020, we see that the curve is nearly half the values
                  in 2020 as it is in 2018 and 2019, suggesting that the onset of COVID19 in LA may have contributed to
                  the drop in business growth. In fact, the drop takes place in February of 2020, which is far lower
                  than the rate in the previous 2 years.

                  <strong><em>Question 5: Is there a difference in the number of new businesses by
                      classification?</em></strong><br><br>
                  In this dataset, there are 291 North American Industry Classification System codes (NAICS). These
                  codes were developed for use by the Federal Statistical Agencies for data related to the US Economy.
                  Using this system, I then wanted to determine if there were changes in the number of new businesses
                  for the top 10 most common NAICS descriptions. Table 4 summarizes these top 10, and well represent the
                  major industries in LA (entertainment, artists/performers, personal services, real estate lessors, and
                  full service restaurants, to name a few). Table 5 then summarizes the total annual number of new
                  businesses by NAICS for each year between 2015-2010, Table 6 provides the annual percent change
                  for the same time period, and Table 7 provides the percent change for each business classification taking only the months of Jan to the end of June into account. <br><br>
                  We see that some of these business classifications were already seeing a drop in growth for nearly 4
                  consecutive years (management, motion picture, lessors of real estate), while some were growing each
                  year (full-service restaurants, and single family housing construction).<br><br>
                  Figure 6 and 7 visualizes these changes for each NAICS.  Figure 7 in particular confirms that when comparing the first half of each year, the numbers of 2020 is a drop over the 2019 levels. Suggesting that for some industries, the economy was already struggling, and the onset of the stay at home order further drove down any potential growth.<br>
