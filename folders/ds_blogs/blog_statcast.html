                  <B>Statcast: </B> is an advance tool that combines doppler radar, and high definition video processing
                  to measure the speed, acceleration, and other moving properties of objects in motion. Statcast is a
                  result of the combined technology of TrackMan, and ChyronHego. Stacast is used in various sports,
                  including Major League Baseball to track in-game biomechanics. In MLB, this is primarily for pitchers
                  and hitters, although it captures all game related activities. The data collected has been used to
                  evaluate player performances, and to help diagnose performance problems that may prevent injuries.
                </p>
                <p class="general-p"><strong>Why is this important?</strong><br>
                  Information gathering technology can provide a competitive edge in sports (and other industries).
                  Statcast in particular, can generate roughly <em>seven terabytes of data</em>, and this information
                  can provide insights that include aid in scouting top talent, and player development. These insights
                  can be powerful, but insights are unlocked from data by good analytics, and having a keen
                  understanding of the data, and the tools available to analyze it, are essential at driving value from
                  gathered data.

                Efforts to identify home run optimal batting parameters has been active area of research for sport leagues, and engineering labs alike. The availability of data imposed a limit until the advent of technologies like Statcast, which  provides a wide portfolio of baseball player biometrics, and batting event outcomes.  This era of big data has made home run mechanics easier to decipher.  When considering batting behaviors in particular, the batting launch angle, and launch speed have become key indicators of home run events.  In fact, these findings have had an impact on the average MLB launch angle and launch speed, with players honing their own batting behaviors in search of the barrel zone.  The objective of this post is to confirm these reports by analyzing the batting events for the top home run
                 batters in the 2019 World Series Team.  <strong>More specifically, this blog will address the following:</strong>

                <em>Identifying top home run batters in 2019 World Series Teams</em>
                <br>
                The top home run batters for the 2019 World Series teams was identified by analyzing the team statistics
                for each team. The team statistics was obtained from the website <a
                  href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/">Baseball-reference</a>. Since the data was unavailable in a
                downloadable format, the python libraries requests, lxml.html, and pandas were used to harvest this data
                from each team webpage. The code used to gather this data can be downloaded in this jupyter notebook <a
                  href="projects/2019_mlb_final_hitters/Extraction_webscraping_html_table.ipynb"

                  (HOU)</a>. To identify the top home run batters, the data was analyzed using the python libraries
                pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The code used to analyze this data can be downloaded in this
                jupyter notebook <a href="projects/2019_mlb_final_hitters/EDA_2019WS_Top_HR_Batters.ipynb"

                <em>Gathering Statcast Data for the top Home Run Batters in the Astros and Nationals</em><br>
                The 2019 Statcast data for each player was retrieved from <a
                  href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search">Baseballsavant.mlb.com</a>. Although this
                website enables users to query their database, it does not provide options to download the results of an
                advance search.
                To this end, a python script developed by <a
                  href="https://github.com/alanrkessler/savantscrapersavantscraper."> Alan R Kessler.</a> was used to
                capture data from advance StatCast searches, and save it into a sqlite database. The python libraries
                sqlite3 and pandas was then used to query and save the data into csv files. Since Statcast uses integer
                IDs to store player identities, the name corresponding to each player ID was determined by inspecting
                the player Statcast page, and searching through the <code>section id="player"</code> tag. This ID number
                was then used to filter for these players in the Statcast 2019 season database. The code used to analyze
                this data can be downloaded in this jupyter notebook <a

                <em>Analysis</em><br>
                Python was used in this project. Data was loaded and manipulated using the pandas library. The
                matplotlib and seaborn libraries were used to visualize data. The scipy, scikit_posthocs, and sklearn
                libraries were used in the statistical analysis. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality,
                while the Barlette's test was used to test for equal variance. An ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test
                was used to test for differences between players, and a logistic regression analysis was used to
                determine if launch speed and launch angle are predictors of home run events. A Pearson Correlation and
                Spearman R test was conducted where appropriate. Detailed methods can be found in the jupyter notebook.  <a
