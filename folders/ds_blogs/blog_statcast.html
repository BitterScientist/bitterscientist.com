                  <B>Statcast: </B> is an advance tool that combines doppler radar, and high definition video processing
                  to measure the speed, acceleration, and other moving properties of objects in motion. Statcast is a
                  result of the combined technology of TrackMan, and ChyronHego. Stacast is used in various sports,
                  including Major League Baseball to track in-game biomechanics. In MLB, this is primarily for pitchers
                  and hitters, although it captures all game related activities. The data collected has been used to
                  evaluate player performances, and to help diagnose performance problems that may prevent injuries.
                </p>
                <p class="general-p"><strong>Why is this important?</strong><br>
                  Information gathering technology can provide a competitive edge in sports (and other industries).
                  Statcast in particular, can generate roughly <em>seven terabytes of data</em>, and this information
                  can provide insights that include aid in scouting top talent, and player development. These insights
                  can be powerful, but insights are unlocked from data by good analytics, and having a keen
                  understanding of the data, and the tools available to analyze it, are essential at driving value from
                  gathered data.

                This research was limited by the availability of data, or it was until
                the advent of technologies like Statcast. Statcast combines advance doppler radar, and high definition
                video processing to generate a wide portfolio of baseball player biometrics, and batting event outcomes.
                This era of big data has made home run mechanics easier to decipher. When considering batting behaviors
                in particular, the batting launch angle, and launch speed have become key indicators of home run events.

                In fact, these findings have had an impact on the average MLB launch angle and launch speed, with

                <br>
                The top home run batters for the 2019 World Series teams was identified by analyzing the team statistics
                for each team. The team statistics was obtained from the website <a
                  href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/">Baseball-reference</a>. Since the data was unavailable in a
                downloadable format, the python libraries requests, lxml.html, and pandas were used to harvest this data
                from each team webpage. The code used to gather this data can be downloaded in this jupyter notebook <a
                  href="projects/2019_mlb_final_hitters/Extraction_webscraping_html_table.ipynb"

                  (HOU)</a>. To identify the top home run batters, the data was analyzed using the python libraries
                pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The code used to analyze this data can be downloaded in this
                jupyter notebook <a href="projects/2019_mlb_final_hitters/EDA_2019WS_Top_HR_Batters.ipynb"

                <strong><em>Gathering Statcast Data for the top Home Run Batters in the Astros and
                    Nationals</em></strong><br>
                The 2019 Statcast data for each player was retrieved from <a
                  href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search">Baseballsavant.mlb.com</a>. Although this
                website enables users to query their database, it does not provide the option to download the results of
                an
                advance search.
                To this end, a python script developed by <a
                  href="https://github.com/alanrkessler/savantscrapersavantscraper."> Alan R Kessler.</a> was used to
                capture data from advance StatCast searches, and save it into an sqlite database. The python libraries
                sqlite3 and pandas was then used to query and save the data into csv files. Since Statcast uses integer
                IDs to store player identities, the names corresponding to each player ID was determined by inspecting
                the player Statcast page, and searching through the <code>section id="player"</code> tag. This ID number
                was then used to filter for these players in the Statcast 2019 season database. The code used to analyze
                this data can be downloaded in this jupyter notebook <a

                <strong><em>Analysis</em><br></strong>
                Python was used in this project. Data was loaded and manipulated using the pandas library. The
                matplotlib and seaborn libraries were used to visualize data. The scipy, scikit_posthocs, sklearn, and <a href="http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/cite/">mlxend</a>
                libraries were used in the statistical analysis. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality,
                while the Barlette's test was used to test for equal variance. An ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test
                was used to test for differences between players, and a logistic regression analysis was used to
                determine if launch speed and launch angle are predictors of home run events. A Pearson Correlation and
                Spearman R test was conducted where appropriate. Detailed methods can be found in the jupyter notebook.

                    There were seventeen possible batting outcomes. These outcomes range from field outs (the most
                    common events), to fielders choice (Figure 5). The top six events, by count, were field outs,
                    strikeouts, walks,
                    singles, doubles, and then home runs.<br> Although this order is used to cluster player batting
                    events in Figure 5, the rankings by magnitude varies by player. Bregman's batting events ranks were

                    <strong><em>Soto's Home Runs have the highest launch speed, while Bregman had the slowest. </em></strong><br>
                    To evaluate the launch angle and launch speeds of home runs by player, individual scatter plots were
                    prepared (Figure 10). The plots suggest that Soto hit the ball with more force, while Bregman had a
                    slower launch speeds than both Rendon and Soto. When comparing the actual summary statistics for these
                    values (Table 2), Soto did indeed have the highest launch
                    speed (M 105.61 mph Â± 4.39 SD), followed by Rendon (M 101.36 Â± 2.76 SD), and ending with Bregman (M
                    99.87 Â± 3.46 SD). A Kruskal-Wallis H-test for independent samples was conducted to test the
                    hypothesis that there was no statistically significant difference in launch speed between players.
                    This hypothesis was rejected (statistic=37.90, pvalue=5.91e-09), and a Dunn Post Hoc analysis
                    confirmed that Soto's launch speed is significantly higher than both Bregman (p = 4.14e-09) and
                    Rendon (p = 0.000133).
                    When comparing launch angles, Rendon had the largest mean angle (M 30.97 Â± 5.00 SD), followed by
                    Bregman (M 39.59 Â± 5.64 SD) and ending with Soto (M 29.51 Â± 5.32 SD).

                <strong><em>Predicting events with Machine Learning.</em></strong><br>
                Machine learning has become a ubiquitous tool in data science.  It enables users to combine advance statistics, and computer science, without having to conduct all the complicated calculations.  So far, Figure 6-9 in this blog suggest that launch speed and launch would be good parameters for identifying home run events.  Although visually convincing, advance statistical techniques would need to be used to determine their use in predicting if a batting events will result in a home run. <br><br>
                <strong><em>Finding the right model: Logistic Regression versus Support Vector Machine </em></strong><br>
                There are several models that can be used to build a predictive algorithm.  Since the target for this dataset are home run events, which are dichotomous by nature ("yes" or "no"; 0 or 1), a logistic regression model seemed ideal.  Although, given the circular clustering of the home run data in Figure 6-9, would suggest that any linear models would underperform in their classification reports. In fact, a logistic regression model yielded an accuracy score >90% for both the training and test set, but performed terribly in the confusion matrix analysis.  The logistic regression model did well at predicting true negatives (which contributed to the high accuracy score), but it did terribly at classifying true positives, and false negatives. In fact, the f1-score for home runs was ~0.30 (data not shown).  If you're wondering why, there are two primary reasons: 1) most events are not home runs, so by the numbers, the logistic regression model will correctly classify these events, 2) the home run events are cluster in a circle, and surrounded by non home run events.  This makes it difficult for a decision boundary to be established using a logistic regression model. For these reasons, SVM is a more appropriate tool, as it allows for complex modeling of data using non linear decision boundaries.<br><br>
                <strong><em>Support Vector Machine Modeling Predicts Home Runs 70% of the time</em></strong><br>
                The non linear SVG was conducted using the gamma and C parameters set to 1.  The accuracy score for both the training and test set was 97%.  Plotting a subset of this data showed that the model built a decision boundary around the area home runs are scored (Figure 11).  Fine tuning of the SVM parameters would be required to in order to optimize this boundary.  Tests to validate the performance of this model showed that the model classified true negatives 99% of the time, false positives 1% of the time, false negatives 32% of the time, and true positives at 68% of the time (Figure 12).  Moreover, the classification report showed that the model had a precision score for home runs at 78%, a recall score at 67%, and an f1-score at 72%.

                <strong><em>Rendon hit faster pitches than Soto.</em></strong>
                Statcast not only tracks the speed of batted events, but it also tracks the speed of the ball as it leaves the pitcher's hand. In the 2019 season, the mean pitch speed for all pitches was 88.9 mph Â± 5.8 SD (N = 187529, any feature with a missing value was excluded).  The the mean pitch speed that Bregman (N = 749, M 89.3 Â± 5.7 SD), Rendon (N= 711, M 89.9 Â± 5.5 SD), and Soto (N = 730, M 88.9 Â± 5.8 SD) encountered at the plate seemed consisted with the season average. Interestingly, the mean pitch speed for events that resulted in a home runs for each player (Table 4).  Both Bregman and Rendon had a slight reduction in their mean pitch speed, while Soto hit faster pitched balls.  To determine if there were differences in the pitch velocities the players encountered at the plate, an   the hypothesis that there was no difference in the mean pitch speeds Bregman, Rendon, and Soto encountered on the place, a Kruskal Wallis H-Test for Independent samples was conducted. This test was used because the pitch speed data for each player was not normally distributed(confirmed by distplot and Shapiro-Wilk test, analysis in jupyter notebook). The Kruskal Wallis H-Test rejected the null hypothesis (statistic=11.371302631364896, pvalue=0.003394321754529458), and a Dunn's post hoc test indicates that the mean pitch speed between Soto and Rendon was significantly different (p = 0.002238), sugesting that overall, Rendon encountered faster pitched balls than Soto, but Soto scored more home runs from faster pitched balls than Rendon.
