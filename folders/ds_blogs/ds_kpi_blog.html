                  Are metrics that businesses use to measure the status of a specific goals. KPis are used to evaluate
                  how effective a company is achieving its key business objectives. KPI's are bifurcated into "High
                  KPIs", which evaluate overall performance, and "Low KPIs", which evaluate departmental processes. A
                  combination of factors influence how KPIs are defined, but in general, KPIs have a specific outcome
                  that can be measured, are attainable, relevant, and has a time-frame.

                  were used in the statistical analysis. Normality was evaluated using a qqplot, while the Barlette's
                  test was used to test for equal variance. A Welch's t-test for two independent samples was used to
                  determine statistical differences between groups that did not have equal variance.

                      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Characterizing the business user demographics is essential at understanding baseline KPIs, but also in
                  developing new specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound KPIs. 1322 unique users were
                  filtered from the customers dataframe. USA had the largest number of users at 539, while Canada has
                  the smallest number of users (Figure 1 top left panel). The mean age of users was 24, and an analysis
                  of the age distribution confirms that this demographic is primarily in their early twenties (skewness
                  = 1.690, Figure 1 top right panel). Most of these users were female (Figure 1, bottom left panel), and
                  60% of all users accessed the app via an android devices (Figure 1 bottom right panel).

                      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To further segment the users of this app, and determine if there were any age differences when looking
                  at gender, device type, and country, a Mann-Whitney rank test or the Kruskal-Wallis H-test for
                  independent samples was conducted. The results from the Mann-Whitney test for gender (pValue = 0.1135)
                  and device (pValue = 0.0656) suggest no statistically significant difference in the central ages
                  between these groups. The result from the Kruskal-Wallis H-test also suggest that there is no evidence
                  that the ages of users in different countries was significantly different. These findings are
                  consistent with a visual analysis of this data (Figure 2).
                  <br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In terms of absolute counts, there were more female users than male users, and there were more females
                  using both android and iOS devices than men. When comparing the age of male and female users by
                  country, the mean age of men was higher in all countries but France (Figure 3 bottom panel, Table 1).<br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Finally, to determine what device types are used to access this app,  user counts by device and country was analyzed (Figure 4). The results are consistent with Figure 1, Figure 2, and and Figure 3, although in this figure, we see that Android users are the majority for all countries.  Suggesting and that any issues with android updates could have an impact on a majority of the app users.<br>
                  <strong>Bottom line:</strong><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Taken together, women users outnumber male users, and although the mean ages of men are generally
                  older for most countries in this dataset, this is not significantly significant.<br>

                  <strong><em>Although, the US has the highest number of users, and total purchases (number and sum), other countries have users that purchase more (number and median price).</em></strong><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To determine the baseline key performance index for purchase prices users made on this app by demographic, an analysis of their purchasing behavior was conducted.<br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;An analysis of the purchases users made by country, reveals that the USA had the highest number of total purchases, and the highest total amount paid, while Canada has the lowest of these two metrics. Although the US ranked the highest in these metrics, Germany and Canada had the highest average number of purchases by user (7.26, and 7.25 respectively), while Turkey  had the highest mean and median purchase price paid by their users (Figure 5 top left panel, and Table 2).<br>
                  When comparing the purchase price users paid by gender, we see that the median price paid by men is higher than women (Figure 5 top right panel), although a Mann-Whitney rank test confirms that this different is not statistically significant (U-Statistic 9.9e5, p-value=0.088).<br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To determine if there was a difference in the median price paid by users on android or IOS confirms no difference (Figure 5 bottom left panel), and when evaluating the age of users on the types of products they purchase by median price, also reveals no meaningful difference (Figure 5, bottom right panel).
                  <br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The next task was to determine if there were any trends in purchase price made by users in different countries, and taking their gender and device type into consideration. A box plot was used to evaluate the distribution of prices paid, and when evaluating this feature according to gender and country, we can see that the only country that had a difference in median purchase price by gender was in Brazil (Figure 6, top left panel). As for device type, we see that in all countries but the US and Germany, android users made purchases at higher prices than the iOSC users (Figure 6, top right panel).
                  <br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Finally, a boxplot was used to determine if there were product preferences by the age and country of the user. There are six products available, and they are represented by their price (0.99, 1.99, 2.99, 4.99, 5.99, and 8.99). In this subplot, we can see that in Brazil, the median age for purchases of these 6 products are between 20-23 yrs of age. In Canada, the 6 products are purchased by users between 18 - 22 yrs of age. In France, the median age of users seems to trend with the price of the product, although this does not seem to be significantly significant. The inverse seems true in German, where the oldest users (median age), seem to prefer the cheapest product (0.99), while the youngest users seem to purchase the most expensive product (8.99). Finally, Turkey and the US seem to have users that purchase all products, and whose media age are between 20-22 yrs of age.  In aggregate, there is no evidence to suggest a trend exist between the user's age, the product price, and the user's country.  All products purchased seem to be made by users in their early twenties, irrespective of the country, and this is further supported by the data visualized in Figure 1 (top right panel).
                  <br>
                  <strong>Bottom line:</strong><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Taken together, although the US has the highest number of unique users, and the highest amount paid, US users spend less, while countries such as Brazil, Turkey, and Germany, have users that spend more per transaction (Figure 5, top left panel). Moreover,there is no evidence that the median price paid varies by gender, device type, or age of user.<br>
                  <strong>Potential KPIs:</strong><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Increase the purchase price paid by users in the USA as they are the country with the highest volume of purchases, but spend less per transaction than other countries.
                  Increase the number of users in Canada, and Germany, as they make more transaction by user.

                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In Figure 6, we began to explore product preferences according to age and country. This analysis revealed no significant trend, although it's conceivable that by further stratifying purchasing data by gender and device type might reveal user preferences.  In Figure 7, we see that when we evaluate the number of purchases of the various products by gender, and men tend to purchase more of the $8.99 product than women, but in general, the most popular products are those that cost 1.99, 2.99, 4.99, and 5.99.  This product purchase pattern was also the same by device type, although android users purchase more of each product than iOS users, although this is can be explained by the higher number of android users than iOSC users (Figure 3, top right panel). When we extend this comparison to country of users, we see the same pattern.<br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When we evaluate the proportion of products purchased by user gender, and country, the most striking difference is that men from every country proportionally, purchase more of the $8.99 product than women (Figure 8).
                  <br>
                  <strong>Bottom line:</strong><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The most popular products, by ranking are: sku_$2.99, sku_$3.99, sku_$4.99, and sku_$1.99. This trend seems to hold when comparing gender, device type, and country of users.  The only exception is that male users tend to purchase more of the products that cost 0.99 and 8.99 by count and proportion.
                  <br>
                  <strong>Potential KPIs:</strong><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Increase the proportion of users that purchase the higher priced product sku_$8.99.
